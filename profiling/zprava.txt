This is a report for the profiling, both for math_lib only and for all

math_lib:
    As we can see, exponentiation and addition, they both incrementing by the input values count.
    If we want to optimise the math_lib, we should focus on them. But they seems quite allright. It seems they cannot be optimised more.

full:
    Without the math_lib one, the only one operations, which are incrementing by the count of input values are rstrip and append.
    Once again, they are both fine with the time. Maybe rstrip could be more optimised by changing it by the some alternative function, but i think it would be useless.

There are no any bigger bottlenecks.
